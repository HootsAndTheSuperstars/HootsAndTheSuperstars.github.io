Hey there! here's what you need to know for now:

Controls:

D, Space, cursor up: jump
cursor left, cursor right: Move left and right
A, cursor down (both in air): use ability 
Maintaining S: run

What to do?

In this game you simply recolect stars and avoid bombs, shrimple! You can destroy the bombs with your ability, but it will stun you and make you vulnerable until you touch ground.

Powers:

Shield: Gives you protection against a bomb and bomb stunning when using your ability, it will give you temporal invulnerability if it breaks.

Secrets: 

For now, there are two secrets, can you find them?

Side notes:

- A lot of stuff is missing righ now, don't expect having a load of content like v1, due to the re-do, a lot of stuff is still on the oven

- The invulnerability time will be indicated with a white flash in Hoots! body, if you see that, you should start avoiding bombs...

- This game is NOT made for mobile, don't try to play it on mobile...

- Credits to: idk, i've been doing this all alone

- This was made with Phaser Engine; using the "FirstGame" as a base
